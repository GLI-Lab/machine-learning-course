It is ultimately your responsibility to acquire and maintain the packages and environments you need.\n\n---\n\n## How pixi Works\n\n**When a lock file exists** (`pixi install`)\n\n- Installs the **exact versions** specified in `pixi.lock` — guarantees identical environments across all team members\n- No resolve step needed, so installation is fast\n\n**When no lock file exists** (`pixi install`)\n\n- Reads constraints from `pixi.toml` (e.g., `>=2.0`) and **resolves** the best matching versions\n- Generates a new `pixi.lock`\n- Slower due to the resolve step\n\n**When `pixi.toml` changes with an existing lock file** (e.g., after `pixi add`)\n\n- The lock file is **updated** automatically\n\n### Project Structure\n\n::: {#427d0050 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nR=np.array([np.random.random(),np.random.random()]) # initial location\n\nprint(\"initial location:\")\nprint(np.round(R,3))\nprint(\"round   location\")\n\neps=.5                         # initial learning speed\n\nfor j in range(50):            # rounds\n    eps=0.85*eps               # decrease the learning speed \n    np.random.shuffle(alls)    # reshuffle the sample\n    for i in range(len(alls)): # loop over points of the whole sample\n        R+=eps*(alls[i]-R)     # update/learning\n    if j%5==4: print(j+1, \"    \",np.round(R,3))  # print every 5th step\n```\n:::\n\n\n```bash\nmy-project/\n├── pixi.toml       ← dependency declaration file  (commit to git)\n├── pixi.lock       ← exact pinned versions         (commit to git)\n└── .pixi/          ← actual environment folder     (add to .gitignore)\n    └── envs/\n        └── default/\n```\n\n---\n\n## One-Time Setup: Install pixi\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n**Install under your own user account — `sudo` is almost never needed.**\n\npixi installs by default to `~/.pixi/`, so no elevated privileges are required. Each project's environment lives inside the project folder under `.pixi/envs/`, so there is no conflict between users or projects.\n:::\n\n### Linux & macOS\n\nExpected time: **~5 minutes**\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install pixi (single binary, no sudo required)\n$ curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh   # if curl is available# if wget is available# if wget is available# if wget is available\n$ wget -qO- https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh    # if wget is available\n\n# 2. Reload your shell to apply PATH changes\n$ source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc depending on your shell\n\n# 3. Verify installation\n$ pixi --version\npixi 0.63.2\n\n# 4. (Optional) Update pixi\n$ pixi self-update\n```\n\nFor the full installation guide, see: <https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/installation>\n\n---\n\n## Everyday Use\n\n### pixi run\n\nRun a command or task inside the project environment.\n\n```bash\n# Run any executable from the environment PATH\npixi run python --version\npixi run jupyter lab\n\n# Run a named task defined in pixi.toml\npixi run <task-name>\n```\n\n- Works for both named tasks and any executable available in the environment PATH\n- If a task and an executable share the same name, **the task takes priority**\n- Automatically updates the lock file and installs the environment if needed\n\n### pixi exec\n\nRun a command in a **temporary, isolated environment** — independent of any `pixi.toml`.\n\n```bash\n# Run python from a temporary environment\npixi exec python --version\n\n# Specify an exact version — pixi exec's key strength\npixi exec --spec \"python=3.12\" python --version\n\n# Start JupyterLab without activating any project environment\npixi exec jupyter lab\n\n# Clean up temporary environment cache when no longer needed\npixi clean cache --exec\n```\n\n- Does not require a `pixi.toml` — works from any directory\n- Useful for one-off version testing or running tools outside your project\n- Each `--spec` creates a fresh temporary environment\n\n### pixi shell\n\nActivate the project environment and stay inside it.\n\n```bash\n$ pixi shell\n# environment is now active — use commands directly\n$ python script.py\n$ jupyter lab\n# when done, exit the shell to deactivate\n$ exit\n```\n\n- Keeps the environment active until you exit the shell\n- Convenient for interactive development and experimentation\n- Equivalent to `conda activate` / `micromamba activate` workflows\n\n---\n\n## Check Current Status\n\n```bash\n$ pixi info\n```\n\nThis shows the pixi version, platform, cache location, and details about all environments defined in the current project — including installed packages, target platforms, and defined tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Command | Environment | Requires pixi.toml | Use case |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `pixi run` | Project environment | ✅ | Automation, CI, team scripts |\n| `pixi exec` | Temporary environment | ❌ | One-off runs, version testing |\n| `pixi shell` | Project environment | ✅ | Interactive development |\n\n",
