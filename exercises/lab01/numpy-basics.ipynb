        "> In Machine Learning, we deal with massive amounts of data (vectors, matrices, tensors). Standard Python lists are too slow and memory-inefficient for these calculations. NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory and operations are implemented in highly optimized C code, making mathematical operations drastically faster. NumPy is the foundational library that modern deep learning frameworks (like PyTorch and TensorFlow) are built upon.\n",
